# Adventum - Android Game App

A group project for the course CSC207H1 - Software Design at Uoft.

The project we created is an android App which consists of several minigames, a login screen, and a statistics page.

This project's main focus was to create a login screen with minigames while making use of Design Patterns, following SOLID principles, and including the Model-View-Presenter Architechtural Pattern. The project was split up into two phases. Phase 1 was meant to be the barebones of the final project, showing off very basic features of the app. Phase 2 is the final product where visuals and functionality where polished.
